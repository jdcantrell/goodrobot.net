        Hi, I'm JD! I am a full-stack engineer with a focus on front-end. I have
        a passion for building systems that power amazing customer experiences.

      <h2 class="company">Opendoor</h2>
      <h3 class="role">Staff Software Engineer - March 2022 - Present</h3>

      <p>
        At Opendoor I work on the Product Growth team developing experiments and
        building out our customer onboarding platform. During my time here I
        have re-architected and streamlined how we describe onboarding flows,
        enabled easier experimentation, and led the implementation of our latest
        brand look and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, my responsibilities include site-reliability engineering
        and DevOps as part of our on-call rotation.

      <h2 class="company">Resilience Insurance</h2>
      <h3 class="role">Staff Software Engineer - July 2019 - February 2022</h3>

      <p>
        Resilience gave me the opportunity to lead a small team responsible for
        designing and developing various customer-facing portals and prototypes
        for exploring market-fit for new products. We built up a foundational
        toolset to quickly build new portals, worked with design to build out a
        design system, and set up processes to ensure high quality.

      <h2 class="company">Trulia</h2>
      <h3 class="role">Principal Software Engineer - May 2011 - Jul 2019</h3>
      <p>
        At Trulia I started as a mid-level engineer and was promoted twice up to
        principal engineer. My team owned the entire customer-facing search
        experience. We put this experience through many design iterations,
        extensive a/b testing of features, SEO improvements, and a lot more. All
        of this took place while delivering the experience at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the consumer-facing search experience, I took part in
        developing Trulia's design system, iterating that system through several
        major versions, multiple migrations to different front-end frameworks
        and applying domain-driven design to our core search library.

      <h3 class="role">Systems Analyst - June 2005 - May 2011</h3>

      <p>
        At AllofE I worked on a small team that took client needs and ideas and
        turned them into full web applications. This gave me a lot of
        opportunities to work closely with our users to develop intuitive
        interfaces to solve their problems.
