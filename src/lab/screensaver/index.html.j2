      <h1>screensaver.js</h1>
      <p>
        A long time ago when I started to get into computers I was in love
        with screensavers. Even to this day one of the first things I do on a
        new system is make sure I have xscreensaver installed. When I went
        through school and started to learn how to do some graphics
        programming I created a screensaver of my own. And then many years
        later I decided to port it over to webgl and make it act as a
        screensaver for a webpage. Pretty pointless, but fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to have this on your own page download <a
        href="js/screensaver.js">screensaver.js</a> and then add the
        following:
      </p>
        <pre>
          &lt;script src="screensaver.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          &lt;script&gt;screensaver().initialize({ delay: 5000 });&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>

    <canvas id="demo"></canvas>
{% endblock %}


{% block javascript %}
    <script src='js/screensaver.js'></script>
    <script>
      const handlers = screensaver().initialize({
        canvas: document.getElementById('demo')
      })
      handlers.start();
    </script>
{% endblock %}
