  <p> The Element Dungeon</p>
<br>
<p> PROLOGUE</p>
<p> My name is Stephine Homer, this is my journal and i am going to a dungeon school so i can go into the Local Dungeon. There are monsters, jerks, and mystreys that lurk down there. ANYWAY, it was the morning and i was getting ready for school and was eatting breakfast when I heard a loud CLANK....</P>

<p> CHAPTER 1
    Seeking Out The Clank....</p>
<br>
<p> Never did find out what that clank was but I passed my Edible Monsters Test today! :)</p>
<br>
<p> NOVEMBER 21 6039 MORNING</P>
<p> Me and my clan of people were in the dungeon for the first time ever. I love it!! You'd think it'd be dark and creepy. But... It's not. It's like a normal forest but in the middle there is a little cottage FILLED with monsters! That's honestly what I like about it you don't have to worry about monsters that come to fight while your asleep, unless you sleep in the cottage which I don't know why you would do such a thing! </p>
<br>
<P> NOVEMBER 21 6039 AFTER NOON</P>
<P> We are going into the cottage now and i know there going to be easy monsters but i'm still scared, Our instructor said it's dangerous to under estimate you enemys but it's just as dangerous as dangerous to over estimate them too. </p>
<br> 
<p> NOVEMBER 21 6039 NIGHT </p>
<P> We luckly beat the first clan of monsters but we're sleeping in the cottage so i'm not so sure on how safe we'll be. I'm up for watch so i don't get to sleep tonight. </p>
