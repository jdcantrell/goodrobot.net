Hello. You're on this page cause something about this site interests
you, and you want to learn a little bit about the person who runs it.
That person is me. JD. Hi! I don't really know what you're looking for
so what follows will sort of a random dump of bits of information about
me.

<img src="http://static.goodrobot.net/cdn/jd.png" style="margin: auto; height: 250px; border: none; display: block">

- I work at [Trulia](http://trulia.com). If you do anything on the site
  related to looking for a house/apartment, then I most likely had a hand
  in it.
- I live in the San Francisco Bay area. It still feels weird
  to me after living most my life in Kansas, and I miss thunderstorms.
- I am still looking for that one project that I can really put some
  soul and heart into.
- I've been a professional developer for 10 years, or rather I've been
  getting paid to write code for that long. I've learned a thing or two
  about writing good code, but still have a long road to go.
- HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, Python, Ruby, C, QBasic (these
  keywords are for recruiters, fingers crossed for a QBasic gig).
- I like to build stuff more than I like to fix bugs.
- I like to make useful stuff more than I like to build stuff.
- I believe life's not fair, but you should be fair to everyone as much
  as you can.
- You don't deserve any of this, good or bad. So be thankful when things
  are good, and fight hard when things are bad.
- I &hearts; vim, chocolate, open source and linux.
- I am a geek and/or nerd.

If a random and unordered list of points about me does not satisfy your
curiosity, please feel free to shoot me a message on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/goodrobot_jd) or send me an
[email](mailto:hello+jd@goodrobot.net).

If you think I can help you build something neat, then take a look at my
[resume](http://goodrobot.net/resume) and

##About goodrobot.net
This is just a playground. It is a collection of random bits of web,
images, noise, and paper that has been rolled into a small corner of the
Internet.

This site was created by a fabric file collecting random python packages
that somehow convert text into html. You can see the details at
http://github.com/jdcantrell/goodrobot.net.
