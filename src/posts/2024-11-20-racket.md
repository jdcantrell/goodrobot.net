title: Seeing error traces in racket repl

I'm trying to replace my usage of DrRacket with neovim, but still haven't found
the right way to run a script and see where the error happens within nvim. It
turns out there's also a bit of work to do to make that happen in the repl as
well:

```
racket -i
```

Once in the repl:

```
> (require errortrace)
> ,en "path/your_file.rkt"
```

And then when/if you run into an error be sure to view the additional context:

```
> ,bt
```

You can also reload your file after any changes by doing `,en` again (or more
likely press the up arrow n times):

```
> ,en "path/your_file.rkt"
```

I also found this [set of helpers](https://barzilay.org/misc/interactive.rkt)
that seem nice while working in the repl.
