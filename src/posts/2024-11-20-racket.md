I'm trying to replace my usage of DrRacket with neovim, but still haven't found
the right way to run a script and see where the error happens within nvim. It
turns out there's also a bit of work to do to make that happen on the repl as
well:

```
racket -i
```

Once in the repl:

```
> ,errortrace
> ,en "path/your_file.rkt"
```

`,errortrace` is short for `(require errortrace)`. When/if you run into an error
be sure to view the additional context:

```
> ,bt
```

You can also reload your file after any changes by doing `,en` again (or more
easily press the up arrow x times):

```
> ,en "path/your_file.rkt"
```

There are more commands and details you can see by entering `,h`
