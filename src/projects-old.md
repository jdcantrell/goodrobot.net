Title: Projects
Date: 2013-11-11

Here are some projects that I've worked in my spare time. All of these
are open source and available on [github](http://github.com/jdcantrell).
These are projects that are complete, mostly complete, or at least still
interesting to me.

##Hologram
Hologram generates a style guide from the documentation you put in your
css/sass/js. You can see the the one I made from styles I used for this
site [here](http://goodrobot.net/gxl). More information can be found at
the [hologram github page](http://github.com/trulia/hologram).

##Ankh
Ankh is a python script that generates html from RSS feeds. You feed it
a jinja2 template and use some of the built in template tags and it
creates your very own custom feed reader. I use this for my
[links page](http://goodrobot.net/stream). Free source codes at
[github](http://github.com/jdcantrell/ankh)

##Luggage
Luggage is a ruby based site that serves as a file dump. This was
inspired by CloudApp. I have this up and running at
[goodrobot.net/share](http://goodrobot.net/share). It can render
differently depending on file types (markdown, source code, images,
etc), but honestly I only use it to share pictures. Source code at
[github](http://github.com/jdcantrell/luggage).

##Others
My github has various other projects that I have completed or left
undone. The most likely one to be useful will be my
[dotfiles](http://github.com/jdcantrell/dotfiles). Anyhow more to come
as they are completed.
