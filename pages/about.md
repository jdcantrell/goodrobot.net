Title: About
Date: 2011-09-16

Hello. You're on this page cause something about this site interests
you, and you want to learn a little bit about the person who runs it.
That person is me. JD. Hi! I don't really know what you're looking for
so what follows will sort of a random dump of bits of information about
me.

<img src="http://static.goodrobot.net/cdn/jd.png" style="margin: auto; height: 250px; border: none; display: block">

* I work at [Trulia](http://trulia.com). If you do anything on the site
  related to looking for a house/apartment, then I most likely had a hand
  in it.
* I live in the San Francisco Bay area, California. It still feels weird
  to me after living most my life in Kansas. And I miss thunderstorms.
* I am still looking for that one project that I can really put some
  soul and heart into.
* I've been a professional developer for 9 years, or rather I've been
  getting paid to write code for that long. I've learned a thing or two
  about writing good code, but still have a long road to go.
* HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, Python, Ruby, C, QBasic (these
  keywords are for recruiters, fingers crossed for a QBasic gig).
* I like to build stuff more than I like to fix bugs.
* I like to make useful stuff more than I like to build stuff.
* I believe life's not fair, but you should be fair to everyone as much
  as you can.
* You don't deserve any of this, good or bad. So be thankful when things
  are good, and fight hard when things are bad.
* I &hearts; vim, chocolate, open source and linux.
* I am a geek and/or nerd.

If a random and unordered list of points about me does not satisfy your
curiosity, please feel free to shoot me a message on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/goodrobot_jd) or send me an
[email](mailto:hello+jd@goodrobot.net).

If you think I can help you build something neat, then take a look at my
